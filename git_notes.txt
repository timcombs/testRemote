 // creating remotes and pushing and pulling

// git remote -v checks for remote repositories
// if you have a remote then it will give you the
// url for fetch and push. the url for fetch is the same
// url for pull.

// having a remote repository allows multiple people to
// work on the same project. they can push changes to
// the remote and pull others' changes

// to create a remote repository we are using gitHub
// create it and then use the push existing repository
// code-- git remote add origin https://of remote --
// in terminal to add remote
// does not matter what branch you are in to do that
// this affects the whole repository

// once the remote repository is added then
// git remote -v will give the urls as stated above

// git push -u origin master then will set the default
// remote as the origin for this project
